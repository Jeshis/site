                <p style="text-align:justify;" > Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans
                    and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
                    The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.

                    1.Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation or approximation of human intelligence in machines.</br>
                    2.The goals of artificial intelligence include computer-enhanced learning, reasoning, and perception.</br>
                    3.AI is being used today across different industries from finance to healthcare.</br>
                    4.Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like.</br>
                    5.Some critics fear that the extensive use of advanced AI can have a negative effect on society.</br>

                <h3 style="text-align:center;" >Understanding AI Applications</h3>
                <p style="text-align:justify;" >When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and 
                novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth. Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human
                intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence 
                include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, 
                to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any subject. But
                others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human experience.</br>
                As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optical character 
                recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.

            <p>
            Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, and it answers it for you.</br>

            Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.
